## Description

## Features
* Custom syntax for Chords
* Last 5 chords are saved within app history
* Generated guitar chord diagram

## How To Use
User can write his text into the prompt. After that, user should click *generate*, which will generate the chord image and sound to play by button. User will have to write his chord in very specific manner. Settings can be changed via prompt, or by menu Window.

### Syntax

#### Settings
`{Name of setting}[value of setting]`

#### Chord notes
* Single note examples:
  * `A4` -> Note A4
  * `A4 + 5` -> Note D4
  * `A4 - 1` -> Note G4b / G4#
* Multi note examples:
  * `A4 ^ E4` -> Powerchord A4
  * `A4 ^ D4 + 2` -> Powerchord A4
  * `A4 ^ C4 ^ E4` -> A minor chord

## Implementation

### Database - notes
* Sound note database should be initialized from **C0** to **C9**
* Init once, give base freq to each one note, based on freqs from this [page]( https://pages.mtu.edu/~suits/notefreqs.html )
* Octave 
  * Starts from ***C*** note
  * Contains 12 notes
    * Third octave consists of notes 
      * {***C3, C#3, D3, D#3, E3, F3, F#3, G3, G#3, A3, A#3, B3***} 
      * Note naming depends on system and context, you can for example meet with notes like ***Db3***, which in context of our program is the same thing as ***C#3***

* Each time when single note frequency is changed, change all to correspond the change.

### Sound engine
Using NAudio;

### GUI
Using WPF XAML

#### Guitar chord diagram
* Standard EADGBE tuning with 24 frets
