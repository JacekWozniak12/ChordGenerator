## Description
Chord Generator is simple program written in C# and Windows Presentation Forms. It lets an user create chords from a text formatted by custom syntax standards, which is written below. Created chords will be displayed as img and be avalaible to play with Midi synthesizer. 

## Features
* Custom syntax for Chords
* Last 5 chords are saved within app history
* Generated guitar chord diagram

## How To Use
User can write his text into the prompt. After that, user should click *generate*, which will generate the chord image and sound to play by button. User will have to write his chord in very specific manner. Settings can be changed via prompt, or by menu Window.

### Syntax

#### Frequency


#### Instrument Type Synthesizer


#### Chord notes


## Implementation

### Database - notes
* Sound note database should be initialized from **C0** to **C9**
* Init once, give base freq to each one note, based on freqs from this [page]( https://pages.mtu.edu/~suits/notefreqs.html )
* Octave 
  * Starts from ***C*** note
  * Contains 12 notes
    * Third octave consists of notes 
      * {***C3, C#3, D3, D#3, E3, F3, F#3, G3, G#3, A3, A#3, B3***} 
      * Note naming depends on system and context, you can for example meet with notes like ***Db3***, which is the same thing as ***C#3***
      * Let's pretend for now that we can write only with sharps.

* Each time when single note frequency is changed, change all to correspond the change.
* Write database as array of the objects based on class

  ```c#
  public class MusicalNote
  {
      private string Name;
      private float Frequency;
      
      public MusicalNote(string name, float freq)
      {
          if( IsValidName(name) )
          	Name = name;
          if( IsValidFrequency(freq) )
          	Frequency = freq;
          if (Name == Null || Frequency == Null)
              Throw New System.ArgumentException("Object lacks name or frequency")
      }
      
      public void ChangeMusicalNote(float freq, bool test)
      {
          if (test) 
              if (!IsValidFrequency(freq))
              {
                 Throw New System.ArgumentException("Frequency out of range")
                 return;
              };
         
           Frequency = freq;
      }
      
      public void ChangeMusicalNote(float freq)
      {
          ChangeMusicalNote(freq, false)
      }
      
      private bool IsValidName()
      {
          // length test
          	// C#3 is 3 symbols
          	// C2 is 2 symbols
          // passed length test
          	// check first char for range <A, G>
          	// check last char for range <0, 9>
          	// if length = 3 check mid symbol for #
          // if passed then true      	
      }
      
      private bool IsValidFrequency()
      {
          // is number?
          // is within range?
          // if passed then true 
      }
  }
  ```
  
* There should be initialized two databases, one which hold change and another, that is fallback, if first one got issues within.

* Database should be changed in order:

  	1. First element (check if is possible to make new frequency)
   	2. Last element (check if is possible to make new frequency)
   	3. Second first to last but one

### Syntax reader
* Order
  * Settings
    * Frequency
    * ...
  * Notes
* Error handling
  * General issues
    * Syntax misspellings
    * Not closed brackets
      * Content within brackets should be only made out of 1 string.
      * Check for type of brackets.
    * Notes out of range 
  * Settings - notes
    * Frequency out of range 

### Sound engine
wip

### GUI

#### Guitar chord diagram
* Standard EADGBE tuning with 24 frets
* Possible chords to play or also those impossible aswell?
  * Possible
    * One note per string
    * Notes can't be stretched more than 5 frets and empty
    * Empty strings are counted before anything else
    * More important notes first
  * Impossible:
    * All notes within a string
    * Notes can't be stretched more than 5 frets and empty
    * Importance does not matter
* History: 
  * From fresh to old.
  * 5 last chords
  * Contains only chord scheme, without additional settings

#### Window

Standard Windows Metro theme

* Modern flat UI
* Rather simple
* *Roboto* or *Montserrat* font suggested.

## Used materials
### Learn X in Y Minutes
* [C# features]( https://learnxinyminutes.com/docs/csharp/ ), most notable:
  * *params string[]*, the way that we can pass objects or arrays

     ```c#
     int MethodSignatures(
              int maxCount, // First variable, expects an int
              int count = 0, // will default the value to 0 if not passed in
              int another = 3,
              params string[] otherParams 
     			// captures all other parameters passed to method
          )
          {
              return -1;
          }
     
     ```
  * *where*, the way of narrowing down types of objects
  
    ```c#
    public static void IterateAndPrint<T>(T toPrint) where T: IEnumerable<int>
            {
                // We can iterate, since T is a IEnumerable
                foreach (var item in toPrint)
                    // Item is an int
                    Console.WriteLine(item.ToString());
            }
    ```
